To fulfill your request, I will create a schema that provides a detailed setup for a vesting schedule for two employees on the Andromeda chain. Each employee will have a unique Vesting ADO and a specified staking process.

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Initialize Vesting ADO for Each Employee:**

   **Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "vesting_ADO": {
       "1": {
         "employee_address": "andr1employee1...",
         "lockup_period": "6 months",
         "release_schedule": "10% monthly"
       },
       "2": {
         "employee_address": "andr1employee2...",
         "lockup_period": "6 months",
         "release_schedule": "10% monthly"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Description:**

   - Each `vesting_ADO` contains information for one employee.
   - Employee 1 and 2 will have their own `vesting_ADO` instances.

2. **Define Staking ADO for Automatic Staking:**

   **Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "staking_ADO": {
       "validator_address": "andr1validator...",
       "auto_stake": true
     }
   }
   ```

   **Description:**

   - The `staking_ADO` sets up a mechanism to automatically stake tokens once they're vested and claimed.
   - Specify the `validator_address` to indicate where the tokens are to be staked.
  
3. **Transfer Ownership to Each Employee:**

   **Steps:**

   - **Vesting ADO Ownership Transfer:**
     ```json
     {
       "transfer_ownership": {
         "ADO_id": "vesting_ADO_1",
         "new_owner": "andr1employee1..."
       }
     }
     ```  
     ```json
     {
       "transfer_ownership": {
         "ADO_id": "vesting_ADO_2",
         "new_owner": "andr1employee2..."
       }
     }
     ```

   - **Staking ADO Ownership Transfer:**
     ```json
     {
       "transfer_ownership": {
         "ADO_id": "staking_ADO",
         "new_owner": "andr1employee1..."
       }
     }
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "transfer_ownership": {
         "ADO_id": "staking_ADO",
         "new_owner": "andr1employee2..."
       }
     }
     ```

   **Description:**

   - Transfer the ownership for both `vesting_ADO` and `staking_ADO` to their respective employees, ensuring they control their tokens and rewards.

This setup ensures that each employee gets their specified vesting schedule and subsequently stakes the released tokens automatically, fully controlled by the employee once ownership is transferred.
