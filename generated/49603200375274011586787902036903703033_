To create a simple vesting and staking application on the Andromeda chain based on your requirements, you need two main components: the Vesting ADO and the Staking ADO. Below is a guideline and a hypothetical schema to configure these components:

### Vesting ADO Configuration

The Vesting ADO will manage the schedule for releasing tokens. You should configure it to hold tokens for 1 year before releasing them intermittently. It may look something like this:

```json
{
  "VestingADO": {
    "token": {
      "denomination": "ANDR",
      "amount": "total_amount_to_vest"
    },
    "recipient": "employee_address",
    "vesting_schedule": {
      "total_duration": "1_year_in_milliseconds",
      "release_increments": "amount_per_release",
      "release_interval": "release_interval_in_milliseconds"
    }
  }
}
```

### Staking ADO Configuration

The Staking ADO will handle the staking of tokens immediately after they have been released from vesting. You can specify the default validator and amount to stake as follows:

```json
{
  "StakingADO": {
    "token": {
      "denomination": "ANDR"
    },
    "recipient": "employee_address",
    "validator": "default_validator_address",
    "stake_action": "auto_stake_on_release"
  }
}
```

### Example Implementation

Assuming you define the `total_amount_to_vest` as `1000000 ANDR`, with releases happening every month (12 intervals in a year), here's how you might configure these components:

```json
{
  "VestingADO": {
    "token": {
      "denomination": "ANDR",
      "amount": "1000000"
    },
    "recipient": "andr1employee...",
    "vesting_schedule": {
      "total_duration": "31536000000",  // 1 year in milliseconds
      "release_increments": "83333",    // Released every month
      "release_interval": "2628000000"  // Every month in milliseconds
    }
  },
  "StakingADO": {
    "token": {
      "denomination": "ANDR"
    },
    "recipient": "andr1employee...",
    "validator": "andr1validator...",
    "stake_action": "auto_stake_on_release"
  }
}
```

### Additional Notes

- **Ownership Transfer**: To ensure employees control their earned tokens and rewards, establish a protocol to transfer ownership once the components are instantiated and configured.
- **Customization**: Adjust the `release_increments` and `release_interval` as needed for different employees or requirements.

This setup will enable the automatic vesting and staking of tokens as per your intended configuration. Adjust the parameters specific to your scenario, such as `total_amount_to_vest`, `release_intervals`, and `validator_address`.
