To address your request, we'll break down the process into specific steps. To mint additional tokens and verify your updated balance, we'll generate relevant messages for the create, send, and query actions. 

First, we need to craft an `ExecuteMsg` to mint 10,000 additional tokens and send them to your wallet:

### Mint and Transfer Tokens

#### Mint Tokens
To mint additional tokens, you'll need to ensure you have permission to mint (usually, the `minter` address specified in the contract). We'll create an `ExecuteMsg` for minting tokens:

```json
{
  "mint": {
    "recipient": "your_cw20_address_here",   // replace with your wallet address
    "amount": "10000"
  }
}
```

#### Transfer Tokens
Then, we'll create an `ExecuteMsg` to send the new tokens to your wallet:

```json
{
  "transfer": {
    "recipient": "your_cw20_address_here",   // replace with your wallet address
    "amount": "10000"
  }
}
```

### Verify Token Balance

Finally, you'll need to generate a `QueryMsg` to check your token balance:

```json
{
  "balance": {
    "address": "your_cw20_address_here"   // replace with your wallet address
  }
}
```

### Additional Steps:
1. **Mint Permission:** Ensure you have minting permissions by verifying you are the designated `minter` or have authorization.
2. **Execute Messages:** Submit the `mint` and `transfer` messages using your current address to mint and send tokens to your wallet.
3. **Query Message:** Use the `balance` query to check your updated token balance after minting and transfer operations.

Make sure to replace `"your_cw20_address_here"` with your specific wallet address when executing the messages or queries.
