To build an NFT Auction app that only allows holders of your custom CW20 token to place bids, you'll need to configure the components as follows:

1. **CW721 Component**:
   - This component will be responsible for minting the NFT collection. You'll need to set it up to generate your desired NFTs.

2. **CW20 Component**:
   - You'll create a CW20 token that serves as the currency for bidding in the auction. This component should be configured to require users to hold at least 500 of these tokens to participate.
   
3. **Auction Component**:
   - Configure the auction component to specify your custom CW20 token as the authorized bidding currency.
   - Set a minimum holding requirement for the CW20 tokens. This could be implemented via a whitelist, or by another mechanism, depending on the exact functionality of your platform.

Here's a sample configuration schema for these components, based on your needs:

```json
{
  "CW721Component": {
    // Configuration for minting the NFT collection
    "InstantiateMsg": {
      "name": "YourNFTCollection",
      "symbol": "YNFT",
      "minter": "your_wallet_address", // Address allowed to mint NFTs
      "royalty_info": {
        "payment_address": "royalty_wallet_address",
        "share": "0.1" // 10% royalty for secondary sales
      }
    }
  },
  "CW20Component": {
    // Configuration for your custom CW20 token
    "InstantiateMsg": {
      "name": "YourToken",
      "symbol": "YTK",
      "decimals": 6,
      "initial_balances": [
        {
          "address": "initial_holder_address",
          "amount": "1000000" // Initial supply distribution
        }
      ],
      "mint": {
        "minter": "your_ministrar_address",
        "cap": "10000000" // Total cap
      }
    }
  },
  "AuctionComponent": {
    // Configuration for the NFT auction
    "InstantiateMsg": {
      "authorized_token_addresses": [
        "nft_contract_address"
      ],
      "authorized_cw20_address": "your_cw20_token_address",
      "kernel_address": "kernel_contract_address"
    },
    "StartAuction": {
      "start_time": {
        "from_now": "3600000" // 1 hour from now
      },
      "end_time": {
        "from_now": "172800000" // 48 hours auction duration
      },
      "coin_denom": {
        "cw20": "your_cw20_token_address"
      },
      "min_bid": "500", // Minimum bid of 500 tokens
      "buy_now_price": "10000", // Optional buy-now price
      "whitelist": [
        // Addresses holding at least 500 tokens can be whitelisted
        "address_with_min_tokens_1",
        "address_with_min_tokens_2"
      ],
      "recipient": {
        "address": "sale_recipient_address"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that only holders of your custom CW20 token who have at least 500 tokens can place bids in the NFT Auction. Adjust the values and addresses specific to your use case.
