To implement a 5% tax rate on each NFT sale in the marketplace component, where the additional cost is directed to a specific address for administrative expenses, you need to update the schema for the `ExecuteMsg` and `InstantiateMsg` in the Marketplace ADO to include tax settings. Below is a suggested schema update:

```json
{
  "description": {
    "InstantiateMsg": {
      "authorized_cw20_address": "Optional CW20 address to authorize for purchasing NFTs. If omitted, any CW20 is allowed.",
      "authorized_token_addresses": "Optional CW721 contract addresses allowed to send NFTs for sale. If omitted, any CW721 can send.",
      "kernel_address": "Required kernel contract address for AMP messaging.",
      "owner": "Optional owner address of the contract. Defaults to message sender.",
      "tax_rate": "The percentage of tax to apply on each sale.",
      "tax_recipient": "The address to send accrued tax revenue."
    },
    "ExecuteMsg": {
      "buy": "Allows users to buy NFTs by specifying token_id and token_address. The buyer will be charged the sale price plus the tax rate."
    }
  },
  "schema": {
    "instantiate": {
      "authorized_cw20_address": "andr1cw20...",
      "authorized_token_addresses": [
        "andr1cw721..."
      ],
      "kernel_address": "andr1kernel...",
      "owner": "andr1owner...",
      "tax_rate": "0.05",
      "tax_recipient": "andr1admin..."
    },
    "execute": {
      "buy": {
        "token_id": "1",
        "token_address": "andr1cw721..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Details:
1. **InstantiateMsg**:
   - **tax_rate**: A float or a string representing the tax rate as a percentage. For example, `"0.05"` for a 5% tax.
   - **tax_recipient**: The address to which the tax should be sent, labeled as `"andr1admin..."` in the sample.

2. **ExecuteMsg**:
   - **buy**: Ensure that the logic for this entry accounts for the calculation of the total cost by adding the specified tax rate to the purchase price, then routing the tax to the `tax_recipient`.

This configuration ensures that buyers are charged the base sale price plus a 5% tax, which is then redirected to the designated address for administrative costs.
