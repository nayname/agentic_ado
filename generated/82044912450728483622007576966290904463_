To fulfill your request of creating a new NFT marketplace using the Andromeda Protocol with a CW721 component for minting and a Marketplace component for selling NFTs, here's the schema configuration:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "CW721",
      "schema": {
        "InstantiateMsg": {
          "name": "Example NFT Collection",
          "symbol": "ENC",
          "minter": "your_minter_address",
          "kernel_address": "your_kernel_address"
        },
        "ExecuteMsg": {
          "batch_mint": {
            "tokens": [
              {
                "token_id": "1",
                "owner": "your_minter_address",
                "token_uri": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qm...",
                "extension": {
                  "publisher": "Your Publisher Name"
                }
              },
              // Repeat the structure above for each token_id up to 100
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Marketplace",
      "schema": {
        "instantiate": {
          "authorized_cw20_address": null,
          "authorized_token_addresses": [
            "your_cw721_contract_address"
          ],
          "kernel_address": "your_kernel_address",
          "owner": "your_owner_address"
        },
        "execute": {
          "receive_nft": {
            "sender": "your_minter_address",
            "token_id": "1",
            "msg": "<base64_start_sale_payload>"
          },
          "update_sale": {
            "token_id": "1",
            "token_address": "your_cw721_contract_address",
            "price": "100000",
            "coin_denom": {
              "native_token": "ustars"
            },
            "recipient": {
              "address": "your_seller_address"
            }
          },
          // Repeat "receive_nft" and "update_sale" configurations for each token_id up to 100
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### Key Points:
- **CW721 Component**: Used to mint a collection of 100 NFTs. You should fill in `your_minter_address`, `your_kernel_address`, and the `token_uri` for each NFT.
- **Marketplace Component**: Configured to sell each NFT at a fixed price of `100000` `ustars`. You need to fill in `your_cw721_contract_address`, `your_kernel_address`, `your_owner_address`, and `your_seller_address`.
- **Sale Duration and Details**: The "base64_start_sale_payload" should include sale metadata like the start and end times to ensure each sale lasts 2 hours.

Please ensure all placeholders like `your_minter_address` and `your_kernel_address` are replaced with actual addresses and information specific to your deployment.
